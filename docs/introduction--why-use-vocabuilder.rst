Enjoy Human-Friendly Dictionary
-------------------------------

Most of the dictionaries are boring. Take consciousness for example,
definition from Oxford Dictionary is

``[MASS NOUN] The state of being aware of and responsive to one’s surroundings:
``

The excellent educators in vocabulary.com makes it fun! For
consciousness, it has short and long meanings, as shown below.

::

    When you are awake and aware of your surroundings, that's
    consciousness. There are different types of consciousness, including
    social consciousness, being aware of injustices in society.

::

    The early Latin word conscius meant "with knowing," but it meant a
    shared knowledge, a meaning that was retained through the 16th
    Century. John Locke was the first to describe consciousness in
    relation to the individual, referring to it as “the perception of what
    passes in a man’s own mind." If you lose consciousness during the
    performance, we'll wake you up with some smelling salts! 

You'd agree with me they are fun, and easy to read. We not only know
the meaning of the word, but also the roots and how to use it in an
excellent situation.
